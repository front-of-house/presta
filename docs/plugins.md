# Plugins

The plugin API is still in the works. The best place to look for what we have
atm are the current deployment adapters:

- [@presta/adapter-netlify](https://github.com/front-of-house/presta/tree/main/packages/adapter-netlify) — builds Presta for deployment to Netlify
- [@presta/adapter-vercel](https://github.com/front-of-house/presta/tree/main/packages/adapter-vercel) — builds Presta for deployment to Vercel
- [@presta/adapter-node](https://github.com/front-of-house/presta/tree/main/packages/adapter-node) — builds Presta for deployment to a custom node server
