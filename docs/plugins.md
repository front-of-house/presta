The plugin API is still in the works. The best place to look for what we have

- [@presta/adapter-netlify](https://github.com/front-of-house/presta/tree/main/packages/adapter-netlify)
- [@presta/adapter-vercel](https://github.com/front-of-house/presta/tree/main/packages/adapter-vercel)
- [@presta/adapter-node](https://github.com/front-of-house/presta/tree/main/packages/adapter-node)
