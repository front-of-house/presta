# Deployment

Presta outputs two types of files: static files (any file type), and serverless functions (JavaScript). They're generated within the `.presta` directory in your project root.

These files are designed to be immediately hostable statically, or directly run
as an AWS lambda.

For convenience, a manifest is dropped into the `.presta` directory as well. It
provides a little more information about the artifacts generated by the build.
