# Install

There are a few ways you can use Presta.

## Scaffolding a new project

Presta ships a handy tool for setting up new projects. Run it, and it will walk
you through the setup.

```bash
npx init presta
```

> Want to add a scaffold template? We'd love the help, just ping us in an Issue.

## CLI

You can do almost everything via the CLI on its own.

```bash
npx presta dev "pages/*"
```

> Run `npx presta -h` for help! For more info, see [the CLI docs](cli.md).

## Direct install

You get the idea.

```bash
npm i presta --save
```

> If you aren't using any Presta runtime APIs, you can also install as a
> dev-dependency.
