# About

Presta is a _minimalist_ web framework. It provides a thin layer on top of familiar
serverless patterns to enable devs to build APIs and HTML pages extremely easily
and quickly.

It's a little different than frameworks like Next and Gatsby in that Presta does
very little of the work for you. Instead, it provides the plumbing and you get
to build on top of it.
